# All-in-one Brand Backend Server

It consists of a blog and an e-commerce backend for now and will be improved in the future with added features.

The description will be updated as soon as the first version of the server is released and bug-free to use. It's being locally tested and the codes are being organized to provide a clear view to the developers. A code sample has been updated to gain an overall idea of the project. Till then, have a nice day...
